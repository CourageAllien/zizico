  <!-- ========== WHO THIS IS FOR ========== -->
  <section class="section who" id="who">
    <div class="container">
      <span class="section__label animate-on-scroll">Built for anyone who sells high-value deals and is tired of sending generic pitches.</span>

      <div class="who__body animate-on-scroll">
        <p>You sell something complex. Your deals are $10K, $50K, $500K+. Every prospect gets a tailored proposal eventually — but by the time your team builds it, the momentum is gone.</p>
        <p>Your competitors are sending PDFs. You're sending a personalized microsite with their name, their pain points, and a solution built around their world. That's the difference between getting ghosted and getting a reply.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="who__intro animate-on-scroll">This works if you're:</p>

      <ul class="who__list animate-on-scroll">
        <li>A SaaS company running ABM on enterprise accounts</li>
        <li>A financial advisor competing for high-net-worth clients</li>
        <li>An agency pitching against firms twice your size</li>
        <li>A medical device rep trying to get 5 more minutes with a surgeon</li>
        <li>A commercial contractor bidding on $10M+ projects</li>
        <li>A consulting firm pursuing a Fortune 500 engagement</li>
        <li>A law firm competing for a corporate client</li>
        <li>An industrial equipment company selling $100K+ machines</li>
        <li>A recruiter pitching a retained search to a new client</li>
        <li>Or anyone else who sends proposals, pitches, or follow-ups to specific high-value prospects</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="who__closing animate-on-scroll">If your deal size justifies spending 30 minutes making a prospect feel like your only client — but you don't have the design resources to do it — <strong>this is for you.</strong></p>

          <h3>vs. Doing It Yourself</h3>
          <p>You could build these in-house, but your designers are working on product and your marketers are running campaigns. A personalized microsite takes 8–12 hours to do well. <strong>We deliver it same day.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="comparison__card animate-on-scroll">
          <h3>vs. Hiring a Freelancer</h3>

        <div class="comparison__card animate-on-scroll">
          <h3>vs. Using Templates</h3>
          <p>Templates are the opposite of personalization. Your prospect can tell when their name was mail-merged into a generic page. <strong>We build from scratch, every time, for every prospect.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="comparison__card animate-on-scroll">
          <h3>vs. A Traditional Agency</h3>

          </button>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>One deliverable for one prospect. A microsite for Acme Corp is one request. A lead magnet for Acme Corp is a separate request. We work on one at a time and move to the next as soon as it's delivered and approved.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Same day. Most deliverables are done within a few hours of submission. Complex requests (like interactive demos with multiple screens) may take slightly longer, but we'll tell you upfront.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Unlimited. We work on one at a time with same-day delivery. As soon as one deliverable is approved, we start the next. If you need parallel capacity, ask us about adding a second subscription.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>We handle the research. You tell us who the prospect is and what you're selling. We dig into their company, their pain points, their tech stack, their public data — and we build the deliverable around what we find. You review and add anything we missed.</p>

          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Your brand assets (logo, colors, fonts), your product/service info, and the prospect's name and company. That's it. A short brief on what you want to achieve helps, but isn't required. We'll ask questions if we need more.</p>

          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>We work on one request at a time. But with same-day delivery, you can cycle through multiple prospects each day. If you need parallel capacity, you can add a second subscription.</p>

          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Pause anytime. Your subscription freezes and picks back up when you're ready. No penalty, no questions. Useful if your team is heads down on existing deals and not prospecting.</p>

          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Absolutely. Everything we build looks like it came from your team. We match your brand, your tone, your visual identity. If you don't have formal brand guidelines, we'll work with what you have (website, logo, existing collateral) and keep it consistent.</p>

            <p>The pilot is one deliverable for $100 — a risk-free way to see our quality on a real prospect you're actively working. The subscription is $999/mo for unlimited deliverables with same-day delivery. Most clients start with the pilot, love the work, and upgrade within two weeks.</p>
